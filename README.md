# NCERT Books Downloader

## Description  
NCERT Books Downloader is a project designed to simplify and improve the process of downloading NCERT books by offering a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI). While the official NCERT [Download Page](https://ncert.nic.in/textbook.php) allows users to select and download books, it provides them in a Zip format with separate files for each chapter, index, and cover page. This application consolidates all these files into a single, easily accessible PDF format, streamlining the download experience.
